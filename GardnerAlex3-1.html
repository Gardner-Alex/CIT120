<h1> Who is Alex Gardner?</h1>
<p>This is a question that has perplexed many individuals throughout the passage of time.  I started off as a wee baby when I was first born.<br>
I was birthed in Valdosta Georgia on Moody Air Force Base.  My time as a baby would not last long for after one short year I would be moved to<br> 
another military base in Florida.  It would be in the lands of Florida that I would spend a good amount of my adolescence learning and exploring who<br>
I am.  I first lived on another military base known as McDill Air Force Base.  It was here that I would attend my first day of elementary and also run away<br>
from school on the same day.  After living there till I was half way through kindergarten I moved off base to the suburbs of Tampa known as Valrico.  I would <br>
live there till I finished my fifth grade. 
</p>
<p>At this point in my life I moved to Ramstein Germany.  It would be here that I would spend most of my teen years.  At this point in my life I had become very fascinated <br>
with videogames.  I spent most of my time playing videogames with my friends.  My time in Germany was perhaps one of the most happiest times of my life.  I got to seem much of <br>
of the German history and architecture that existed and was highly impressed.  It would also be the first place that I would see snow.  I would then move from this great land to <br>
Texas.  Here is where I was the most depressed.  I had two years left of HIgh School and no friends.  The LDS church that I went to was not that strong here so I became the only priest <br>
there.  I survived those lonely years and eventually served a mission.  After those two years I would later go to BYUI for college hoping to find a wife.  after going for one year I went <br> 
back down to Texas for a YSA conference in Carlsbad Caverns where I would meet the love of my life and later marry a year later.

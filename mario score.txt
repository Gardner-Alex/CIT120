began playing Saturday and played through Sunday.
30  8610 For this score I Killed every enemy and got every coin and power up.
60 14930 For this score I found that using the pipe makes all the items and enemies reappear.  I went back and grabbed as many items and killed as many enemies as I could.
0  16510 Using the pipe trick I constantly went in the pipe and then used the pow below it to convert the blocks into coins and would then fly up to the pipe again.
40 12850 I made sure to hit every enemy and get every coin on the way to the pipe and then tried my pip trick.
13 16480 I used the pipe trick but was not skilled as my last attempt.

Mix of both
285 17100  I just ran through it at a normal speed and hit all the enemies in my way.  Lost my racoon tale and stayed to the bottom.

216 16850  Got all the coins in the sky and went down the pipe.
266 15400  Got both power ups and then just ran through letting myself loose both power ups.
230 17550  Ran along the bottom and hit all the enemies in my way.
222 18410  only got coins that were in my way and hit enemies that were in my way.  Hit the pow and got coins and then went through pipe and only got coins in my way up there.
